This directory contains work done on creating asynchronous copying utilities.

- use `make run_cp` to test the baseline cp utility performance.
- use `make run_acp` to test the POSIX aio version
- use `make run_lacp` to test the Linux aio version

- use `make run_all` to run all tests

Append `-s` to your make command to only see the resulting time.
